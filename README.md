# Skynet

This is my default skynet filter list running on Asus-Merlin firmware for Asus routers (for more info on what Skynet is, please read below) ... for now.  Will change depending on the amount of inconvenience this brings to the members in our household.  ;)

Skynet is the first comprehensive IP banning and security tool exclusively for Asus Devices.

The goal of this tool is to enhance the firmware's built in functionality such as the SPI Firewall, Brute Force Detection and AiProtect while adding easy to use tools for users to implement custom firewall rules they desire. Skynet has a range of feature from banning single IPs, domains, entire countries or pulling predefined malware lists from reputable providers. Skynet can also be used to secure IOT device and prevent them from phoning home. It is the one stop shop for router security and the first line of defense in your home network.
